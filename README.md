### Project Initialization

- In VSCode, install plugins **Prettier - Code formatter** and **ESLint** and configure them
- Clone this repo, enter it
- Run command `npm run setup`
- _NB: To launch the backend server, you'll need an environment file with database credentials. You'll find a template one in `backend/.env.sample`_
- _NB: To launch the frontend, you'll need an environment file with database credentials. You'll find a template one in `frontend/.env.sample`_
- Run command `npm run migrate`

- `dev-front` : Starts the React frontend server

- _Prettier_ : "Quality of code" tool as well, focuses on the styleguide
